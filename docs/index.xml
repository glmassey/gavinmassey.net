If using the Windows Firewall, this command will help:&#xA;Set-NetFirewallRule -Name WINRM-HTTP-In-TCP -RemoteAddress Any 2. On the Client Machine (from where you want to initiate the connection) Trust the Remote Host: If your remote host is not part of a domain or the certificate used by the remote host is not trusted, you need to add the remote host to your list of trusted hosts:</description>

      <description>In the realm of modern network infrastructures, where high-bandwidth connections like 10 Gbps are common, it might seem that the configuration of traditional Active Directory (AD) sites and subnets is less relevant. However, this perception overlooks the myriad of benefits that a well-configured AD environment can bring, even in high-bandwidth scenarios. Here are several key reasons why configuring AD sites remains a crucial practice:&#xA;Enhanced Authentication and Resource Access: By defining AD sites, you ensure that client authentication occurs at the nearest domain controller.</description>

      <description>PowerShell&amp;rsquo;s integration with the .NET framework allows for leveraging a variety of functionalities via static and instance members of classes. Grasping the differences between these two types of members is key to proficient scripting and effective system administration.&#xA;Static Methods and Members What Are They? Static methods and members are associated with the class itself rather than any specific object created from the class. They can be accessed directly using the class name, eliminating the need to create an instance of the class.</description>

      <description>In PowerShell, the param keyword is used to define parameters that a script or function can accept. Parameters allow you to pass values into scripts and functions, making them more flexible and reusable. By providing different arguments, users can tailor the behavior of a script or function without modifying its actual code.&#xA;Features of the param Block:&#xA;Positional Parameters: By default, parameters are positional, and values are assigned based on the order they appear in the param block.</description>

      <description>VMware Workstation performs a significant amount of low-level networking operations to manage virtual networks for virtual machines (VMs). To achieve this, it installs special drivers and creates virtual network devices that integrate with the host system&amp;rsquo;s networking stack. Here&amp;rsquo;s how VMware modifies your system to enable its networking capabilities:&#xA;Virtual Network Adapters: VMware installs virtual network adapters for different types of networks (like VMnet1 for Host-Only and VMnet8 for NAT by default).</description>

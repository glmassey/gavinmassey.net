<hr>
<h2 id="value-proposition-of-the-aws-cloud">Value proposition of the AWS Cloud</h2>
<p>AWS Cloud offers a broad set of global cloud-based products including compute, storage, databases, analytics, networking, mobile, developer tools, management tools, IoT, security, and enterprise applications. These services help organizations move faster, lower IT costs, and scale applications. Key benefits include agility and innovation, elasticity, a pay-as-you-go pricing model, global reach, and a broad set of tools and services.</p>
<h2 id="aws-well-architected-framework">AWS Well-Architected Framework</h2>
<p>The AWS Well-Architected Framework provides a consistent approach for customers and partners to evaluate architectures and implement scalable designs. It consists of five pillars: Operational Excellence, Security, Reliability, Performance Efficiency, and Cost Optimization. Each pillar focuses on specific aspects of architecture and provides a set of best practices and guidelines.</p>
<h2 id="cloud-adoption-strategies">Cloud adoption strategies</h2>
<p>Cloud adoption strategies involve the plans and approaches that organizations take to move their operations to the cloud. Key strategies include re-hosting (lift-and-shift), re-platforming (lift, tinker, and shift), re-purchasing (move to a different product), refactoring/re-architecting (reimagine how the application is architected and developed), and retain (keep applications on-premises) or retire (get rid of outdated applications).</p>
<h2 id="resources-to-support-the-cloud-migration-journey">Resources to support the cloud migration journey</h2>
<p>Resources for cloud migration include AWS Migration Hub for tracking progress, AWS Application Discovery Service for understanding on-premises applications, AWS Database Migration Service for moving databases, AWS Server Migration Service for moving on-premises servers, and AWS Snow Family for large-scale data transfers. AWS also offers various support plans, training, and professional services to assist in the migration.</p>
<h2 id="aspects-of-cloud-economics">Aspects of cloud economics</h2>
<p>Cloud economics refers to the financial aspects of cloud computing and includes concepts like cost savings, operational expenses (OpEx) versus capital expenses (CapEx), and the total cost of ownership (TCO). It also involves understanding and managing costs with tools like AWS Cost Explorer and AWS Budgets, and optimizing expenses with services like AWS Trusted Advisor and AWS Compute Optimizer.</p>
<h2 id="cost-savings-of-moving-to-the-cloud">Cost savings of moving to the cloud</h2>
<p>Moving to the cloud can lead to significant cost savings due to reduced upfront capital expenditure. Instead of investing in data centers and servers before knowing how they will be used, cloud computing allows businesses to pay only for the compute power, storage, and other resources they use. The variable expense model eliminates the need for guessing capacity needs, and economies of scale mean lower pay-as-you-go prices.</p>
<h2 id="aws-shared-responsibility-model">AWS shared responsibility model</h2>
<p>The AWS shared responsibility model outlines that AWS is responsible for securing the infrastructure that runs AWS services in the AWS Cloud, while AWS customers are responsible for securing their data and applications in the cloud. This includes managing the guest operating system, configuring AWS-provided security group firewalls, and encrypting data.</p>
<h2 id="aws-compliance-and-governance-concepts">AWS compliance and governance concepts</h2>
<p>AWS provides several compliance and governance tools to ensure that cloud infrastructure meets required standards and regulations. AWS Artifact offers on-demand access to AWS compliance reports. AWS Config helps track and manage configurations. AWS CloudTrail provides governance, compliance, and operational and risk auditing of the AWS account. These tools assist in maintaining compliance with various regulatory standards.</p>
<h2 id="benefits-of-cloud-security-for-example-encryption">Benefits of cloud security (for example encryption)</h2>
<p>Cloud security, such as encryption, offers significant benefits in protecting data. Encryption enhances data privacy and security, making it unreadable without the correct decryption keys, thus protecting it from unauthorized access. AWS provides various encryption options, both in transit and at rest, across its services, ensuring that sensitive data is securely managed.</p>
<h2 id="where-to-capture-and-locate-logs-that-are-associated-with-cloud-security">Where to capture and locate logs that are associated with cloud security</h2>
<p>Logs related to cloud security can be captured and located using services like Amazon CloudWatch, which collects and tracks metrics, collects and monitors log files, and sets alarms. AWS CloudTrail further supports security by providing a history of AWS API calls for an account, including API calls made via the AWS Management Console, AWS SDKs, command line tools, and other AWS services. These logs are invaluable for auditing and security monitoring.</p>
<h2 id="identity-and-access-management-for-example-aws-identity-and-access-management-iam">Identity and access management (for example, AWS Identity and Access Management [IAM])</h2>
<p>AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) allows you to manage access to AWS services and resources securely. Using IAM, you can create and manage AWS users and groups, and use permissions to allow and deny their access to AWS resources. IAM is integral to AWS security and enables you to control who is authenticated (signed in) and authorized (has permissions) to use resources.</p>
<h2 id="importance-of-protecting-the-aws-root-user-account">Importance of protecting the AWS root user account</h2>
<p>The AWS root user account has full access to all resources in the AWS account. It is critical to protect this account to prevent unauthorized access that could lead to potential security risks or misuse. Best practices include using a strong password, enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA), and limiting the use of the root account, preferring IAM users with necessary permissions for daily tasks.</p>
<h2 id="principle-of-least-privilege">Principle of least privilege</h2>
<p>The principle of least privilege in AWS means giving a user permission only for the resources and actions they need to perform their job and nothing more. This minimizes the risk of an unauthorized access or accidental changes to sensitive resources. Regularly reviewing and revising permissions ensures that users have only the access they require.</p>
<h2 id="aws-iam-identity-center-aws-single-sign-on">AWS IAM Identity Center (AWS Single Sign-On)</h2>
<p>AWS IAM Identity Center (formerly AWS Single Sign-On) simplifies the process of managing access to AWS accounts and business applications. It enables users to sign in to a central portal to access all their assigned AWS accounts and applications. This centralized access helps in managing permissions and streamlines the process for users to gain access to the resources they need.</p>
<h2 id="security-capabilities-that-aws-provides">Security capabilities that AWS provides</h2>
<p>AWS offers a comprehensive set of security capabilities to increase privacy and control network access. These include network firewalls built into Amazon VPC, encryption in transit with TLS across all services, private or dedicated connections from your office or on-premises environment, customer-controlled encryption in transit and at rest, and identity and access control to secure access to AWS services. AWS infrastructure is designed to keep data safe, with continuous compliance checks, and automated threat detection and mitigation.</p>
<h2 id="security-related-documentation-that-aws-provides">Security-related documentation that AWS provides</h2>

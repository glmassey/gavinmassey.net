<p>Welcome to gavinmassey.net! I’m Gavin, a Computer Engineering graduate from the University of Utah with over 12 years of experience in the IT field. Currently employed as a Networking and Systems Engineer, I specialize in designing and managing robust network infrastructures and systems. Beyond my professional role, I’m an avid traveler, having visited 20+ countries, and I enjoy hiking near my hometown of Salt Lake City, Utah.</p>
<h2 id="about-this-site">About This Site</h2>
<p>Welcome to gavinmassey.net, a platform dedicated to my professional explorations and insights. This site is where I compose and share technical articles, serving as both a personal knowledge repository and a resource for fellow IT professionals. The content here is created with a focus on crystallizing my knowledge and experiences in the IT field into a persistent, accessible format.</p>
<p>Using generative AI, I transform my notes into more presentable articles, allowing me to dedicate more time to technical endeavors while ensuring the content remains easily readable. Please note, these articles are not created for beginners; they are intended for those with a grounding in IT. Additionally, while I endeavor to ensure accuracy, the completeness and correctness of these notes cannot be guaranteed.</p>

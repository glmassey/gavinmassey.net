<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
<p>Welcome to gavinmassey.net! I’m Gavin, a Computer Engineering graduate from the University of Utah with over 12 years of experience in the IT field. Currently employed as a Networking and Systems Engineer, I specialize in designing and managing robust network infrastructures and systems. Beyond my professional role, I’m an avid traveler, having visited 20+ countries, and I enjoy hiking near my hometown of Salt Lake City, Utah.</p>
<h2 id="about-this-site">About This Site</h2>
<p>This site is where I compose and share technical articles, serving as both a personal knowledge repository and a resource for fellow IT professionals. The content here is created with a focus on crystallizing my knowledge and experiences in the IT field into a persistent, accessible format.</p>
<p>Using generative AI, I transform my notes into more presentable articles, allowing me to dedicate more time to technical endeavors while ensuring the content remains easily readable.</p>
<p>Please note, these articles are not created for beginners; they are intended for those with a grounding in IT. Additionally, while I endeavor to ensure accuracy, the completeness and correctness of these notes cannot be guaranteed.</p>

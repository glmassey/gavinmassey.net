<h3 id="objective-116-functionality-of-vmware-distributed-resource-scheduler-drs">Objective 1.16: Functionality of VMware Distributed Resource Scheduler (DRS)</h3>
<p>VMware Distributed Resource Scheduler (DRS) groups VMware ESXi hosts into resource clusters to manage the computing needs of different business units. It offers:</p>
<ul>
<li>High Availability: Provides highly available resources to workloads.</li>
<li>Workload Balance: Balances workloads for optimal performance.</li>
<li>Resource Management: Allows scaling and managing computing resources without service disruption.</li>
</ul>
<p>DRS is included in the vSphere Enterprise Plus package and enables:</p>
<ul>
<li>Service Level Improvement: Guarantees appropriate resources to virtual machines.</li>
<li>Cluster Flexibility: Deploys new capacity to a cluster without service disruption.</li>
<li>Maintenance Support: Automatically migrates virtual machines during maintenance.</li>
<li>Infrastructure Monitoring: Monitors and manages more infrastructure per system administrator.</li>
</ul>
<p>Combined with VMware vSphere Distributed Power Management (DPM), it optimizes power consumption within a cluster. DPM adjusts host power usage based on demand, cutting power and cooling costs during low utilization periods.</p>
<h3 id="technical-details-of-drs">Technical Details of DRS</h3>
<ul>
<li>Initial Workload Placement: On powering a virtual machine in a cluster, DRS places it on a suitable host or generates a recommendation based on the chosen automation level.</li>
<li>Automated Load Balancing: Distributes virtual machine workloads across vSphere hosts in a cluster, optimizing performance.</li>
<li>Power Consumption Optimization: DPM and DRS together manage power consumption at cluster and host levels, dynamically adjusting to workload demands.</li>
<li>Cluster Maintenance: Facilitates the VMware vSphere Update Manager remediation process by optimizing the number of hosts entering maintenance mode.</li>
<li>Constraint Correction: Ensures distribution of virtual machines across vSphere cluster hosts complies with user-defined rules during host failures or maintenance.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="objective-117-given-a-drs-score-identify-the-meaning">Objective 1.17: Given a DRS score, identify the meaning</h3>
<p>The DRS migration threshold in VMware vSphere Distributed Resource Scheduler (DRS) determines the aggressiveness of DRS in recommending VM migrations to balance resources in a cluster. The threshold has five settings, ranging from Conservative to Aggressive:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conservative Setting: Generates only priority-one recommendations, which are mandatory.</li>
<li>Aggressive Setting: More frequent recommendations for migrations to improve VM happiness.</li>
</ul>
<p>The DRS score is a measure of VM happiness or execution efficiency:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each migration recommendation is computed using the VM happiness metric, displayed as the DRS Score in the cluster&rsquo;s Summary tab.</li>
<li>The Cluster DRS Score is a weighted average of the VM DRS Scores of all powered-on VMs in the cluster.</li>
<li>The color of the gauge component&rsquo;s filled section changes based on the score value, corresponding to the VM DRS Score histogram.</li>
<li>The histogram shows the percentage of VMs with a DRS Score in a specific range.</li>
<li>You can view VMs sorted by their DRS score in ascending order in the Monitor tab of the cluster.</li>

<h3 id="objective-118-use-cases-for-enhanced-vmotion-compatibility-evc">Objective 1.18: Use Cases for Enhanced vMotion Compatibility (EVC)</h3>
<p>Enhanced vMotion Compatibility (EVC) ensures vMotion compatibility among hosts in a cluster:</p>
<ul>
<li>EVC makes sure all hosts present the same CPU feature set to VMs, even if actual CPUs differ, preventing vMotion failures due to CPU incompatibilities.</li>
<li>Configuring EVC involves setting all host processors in a cluster to present a feature set of a baseline processor (EVC mode).</li>
<li>EVC mode is based on the host with the smallest feature set and uses AMD-V Extended Migration or Intel FlexMigration technology to mask processor features.</li>
<li>EVC allows VMs to take advantage of faster processor speeds, more CPU cores, or hardware virtualization support available on newer hosts.</li>
<li>It doesn&rsquo;t prevent VMs from accessing hidden CPU features in all circumstances; applications not following CPU vendor recommended methods of feature detection might behave unexpectedly.</li>
<li>From vSphere 7.0 Update 1 onwards, EVC can be used for Virtual Shared Graphics Acceleration (vSGA), allowing multiple VMs to share GPUs for 3D graphics acceleration.</li>

<h3 id="objective-75-concepts-of-role-based-user-management-in-vsphere">Objective 7.5: Concepts of Role-Based User Management in vSphere</h3>
<p>Role-based user management in VMware vSphere is an essential component for securing and efficiently managing a virtual environment. It involves assigning specific roles with defined privileges to users or groups. Here&rsquo;s a detailed explanation based on vSphere Security Update 1 - VMware vSphere 7.0:</p>
<h4 id="using-roles-to-assign-privileges">Using Roles to Assign Privileges</h4>
<ul>
<li>Roles: Predefined sets of privileges.</li>
<li>Privileges: Rights to perform actions and read properties.</li>
<li>Assignments: Pairing a user or group with a role, associated with an inventory object. Different roles can be assigned for different objects.</li>
<li>Example: Group Sales can have Virtual Machine User role on Pool A and Read-Only role on Pool B.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="system-roles-and-sample-roles">System Roles and Sample Roles</h4>
<ul>
<li>System Roles: Permanent and non-editable.</li>
<li>Sample Roles: Provided by VMware for common tasks. Can be cloned, modified, or removed.</li>
<li>Customization: It’s advisable to clone a sample role first before making changes.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="custom-roles-in-vcenter-server-and-esxi">Custom Roles in vCenter Server and ESXi</h4>
<ul>
<li>vCenter Server Custom Roles: Created using the vSphere Client for managing privilege sets.</li>
<li>ESXi Custom Roles: Created using CLI or VMware Host Client for individual hosts. Not accessible from vCenter Server when managing ESXi hosts through it.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="creating-a-custom-role">Creating a Custom Role</h4>
<ul>
<li>Process: Involves logging into the vCenter Server, accessing the Roles section in Administration, and creating or cloning a role.</li>
<li>Privilege Selection: Choosing appropriate privileges for the role.</li>
<li>Propagation: Role changes made in one vCenter Server are propagated to others in the same Single Sign-On domain.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="vcenter-server-system-roles">vCenter Server System Roles</h4>
<ul>
<li>Administrator Role: Full access and rights, including assigning privileges.</li>
<li>Read-Only Role: Viewing state and details of objects without modification rights.</li>
<li>No Access Role: No visibility or modification rights.</li>
<li>Other Roles: Including No Cryptography Administrator, Trusted Infrastructure Administrator, and more.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="best-practices-for-roles-and-permissions">Best Practices for Roles and Permissions</h4>
<ul>
<li>Assign to Groups: Preferably assign roles to groups rather than individual users.</li>
<li>Minimum Necessary Privileges: Grant only required privileges for necessary tasks.</li>
<li>Use of Folders: Helpful in grouping objects for permissions management.</li>
<li>Root Level Caution: Be cautious when adding permissions at the root level.</li>
<li>No Access Role for Masking: Use No Access role to restrict visibility in certain areas.</li>
<li>License Propagation: License changes propagate across vCenter Server systems in the same domain.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="required-privileges-for-common-tasks">Required Privileges for Common Tasks</h4>
<ul>
<li>Task-Specific Privileges: Many tasks require permissions on multiple objects. For example, creating a VM requires privileges on the destination folder, host, datastore, and network.</li>
<li>Propagating Permissions: Ensuring that permissions are set correctly at different hierarchy levels for successful task completion.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, role-based user management in vSphere is a powerful tool for administrators to control and delegate access within the virtual environment. It allows precise control over what actions users and groups can perform, enhancing both security and operational efficiency.</p>

<h3 id="objective-710-performing-and-monitoring-vmotion-storage-vmotion-and-cold-migrations">Objective 7.10: Performing and Monitoring vMotion, Storage vMotion, and Cold Migrations</h3>
<h4 id="migrating-virtual-machines">Migrating Virtual Machines</h4>
<ul>
<li>Types of Migration:
<ul>
<li>Cold Migration: Moving powered-off or suspended VMs to a new host or datastore.</li>
<li>Hot Migration (vMotion): Moving powered-on VMs to a new host without interruption.</li>
<li>Storage vMotion: Moving VM disk files to a different datastore while VM is running.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>CPU Compatibility: Check for CPU compatibility during cold migrations.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="cold-migration">Cold Migration</h4>
<ul>
<li>Process: Involves moving VM files to a new host/datastore with the VM powered off or suspended.</li>
<li>Network Traffic: Transferred via management network by default; can be redirected to provisioning TCP/IP stack for high volumes or long-distance migrations.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="migration-with-vmotion">Migration with vMotion</h4>
<ul>
<li>Use Cases: Maintenance, load balancing, resource reallocation.</li>
<li>Requirements: Hosts must meet specific networking, storage, and CPU requirements.</li>
<li>Stages: Verification of VM state, state information transfer, resumption of VM on the new host.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="storage-vmotion-1">Storage vMotion</h4>
<ul>
<li>Functionality: Allows VM disk migration without downtime, useful for storage maintenance and reconfiguration.</li>
<li>Requirements: VM disks must be in persistent mode or RDMs.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="additional-considerations">Additional Considerations</h4>
<ul>
<li>VM Network Compatibility: Ensure compatibility between source and destination networks.</li>
<li>MAC Address Management: Handle MAC addresses carefully to avoid duplication.</li>
<li>Swap File Location: Affects vMotion compatibility.</li>
<li>vMotion Without Shared Storage: Allows for cross-cluster and cross-datacenter migrations.</li>
<li>Migration Between vCenter Server Systems: Requires specific conditions, such as Enhanced Linked Mode and time synchronization.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="best-practices-for-migration">Best Practices for Migration</h4>
<ul>
<li>Planning: Assess requirements and limitations for each migration type.</li>
<li>Monitoring: Track migration progress and performance impacts.</li>
<li>Troubleshooting: Address any errors or issues that arise during migration.</li>
<li>Documentation: Keep records of migrations for audit and review purposes.</li>
</ul>
